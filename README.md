# Ergodic Experiment

Based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1vXAHGIpfc&t=360s&ab_channel=GreshamCollege).

Run this experiment with this command: 

`python main.py`

Try adjusting the `BET_PERCENT` to .25 to see the median amount won increase. 

Conclusion: by having more "small bets" in the system, you increase your chances of winning the game.
