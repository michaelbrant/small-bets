ENSEMBLES should be an array of arrays. Each ensemble is a person but a person can have multiple bets.
For example, if there were 2 ensembles and each ensemble had 4 bets of 25%, initial ENSEMBLES value would look like:
[[25,25,25,25],[25,25,25,25]]
Each person, AKA "ensemble", will get to play 4 games.
